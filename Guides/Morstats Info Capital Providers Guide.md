# Morstats.info User Guide
This guide serves to walk users through the process of using the MorStats.info dashboard and analytics. It also includes several key sections of code for others wanting to build similar dashboards and analytics.

## Background
MorStats.info serves as a home page for capital providers. It offers real-time data and analytics for capital providers. It is often referenced by the discord community as a reference for new users or those looking for more information on the capital providing during the bootstraph period.

## Home Page
The landing page provides the following six key pieces of data:
1) Boostrap End - The countdown shows how many days, hours, minutes, and seconds remain in the 90 day bootstrapping period that began on February 8, 2024 at 12:00 PM UTC and is scheduled to end on May 8, 2024 at 12:00 PM UTC.
2) Morpheus Staked Ethereum - API pull from Etherscan that returns the stETH contained within the multi-sig wallet representing the total contributions.
3) Days Since Kickoff - The number of days elapsed since the bootstrap period kicked off on February 8, 2024 at 12:00 PM UTC.
4) Today's Daily Emissions - The number of MOR tokens emitted for the current day. This is calculated by day 1 emissions of 14,400 with an emission reduction of 2.468994701 each subsequent day.
5) Total Circulating Supply - The total number of MOR tokens that are technically circulating (although not yet distributed). This is represented by 14,400 on Day 1 with an emission reduction of 2.468994701 each subsequent day.
6) Today's Capital Emissions - The number of MOR tokens emitted for the current day that are distributed to the Capital Providers. This is calculated by day 1 emissions of 14,400 with an emission reduction of 2.468994701 each subsequent day, with 24% of that supply going to Capital Providers.

## Staked ETH Page
The primary calculation page for Capital Providers to understand their expected MOR emissions:
1) Morpheus Staked Ethereum - API pull from Etherscan that returns the stETH contained within the multi-sig wallet representing the total contributions.
2) Staked Ethereum Withdrawn - API pull from Etherscan that analyzes transactions to identify stETH withdrawn that was previously deposited. Note: This amount has already been excluded from the 'Morpheus Staked Ethereum' so there is no need to manually calculate.
3) Total stETH Contribution Yield - Provides the total earnings from the deposited stETH to Morpheus. The yield on the deposited stETH goes to the protocol which will help to launch the initial liquidity. Yield is provided in both ETH and USD values.
4) MOR Earned per stETH - Based on the current number of stETH contributed in total, this section gives the calculated MOR earned for each stETH contributed to provide a baseline for expected earnings.
5) MOR Calculation - Input box for the user to write in their number of stETH contributed. The calculator then shows the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly MOR emissions. It also has a calculation to show the expected MOR to be earned between the current date and the end of the Bootstrap period.
6) At the bottom of this page, the etherscan wallet address and contract can be found to allow for users to verify all data.

## Emissions Page
Detailed schedule showing the daily emissions broken down by
1) Day
2) Date
3) Circulating Supply
4) Total Emissions (Daily)
5) Community Allocation
6) Capital Allocation
7) Code Allocation
8) Compute Allocation 
9) Protection Allocation

## Code Weights Page
Details surrounding the newly released code weight guidance and emission schedules. Provides supporting documentation to help community understand potential earnings from the contribution of code.
1) Annual Earnings Calculator - Users can enter their own estimates for MOR price and their Code Weights. The resulting output provides the comparison against total annual weights, the estimated annual MOR earned, and the estimated USD earned.
2) The Estimated Earnings table provides a schedule showing the expected emissions schedule, cumulative weights, MOR earned per weight, a hypothetical MOR price, and then the resulting monthly value of weights. This helps to provide a framework for users to better think through the value of weights.

## MOR Price Projection Page
Detailed Schedule the projected MOR price based on various overall market capitalization amounts. This provides a dropdown with two calculation methodologies and associated tables: Capital Provider stETH Yield Method and the Market Cap vs Supply Method. This provides two different ways for the community to think through potential prices.
1) Estimated Market Cap
2) MOR price projection based off of the circulating supply at Day 90
3) MOR price projection based off of the circulating supply at end of Year 1
4) MOR price projection based off of the max supply of 42,000,000. Also known as the fully diluted value (FDV)

Alternative pricing model that is based off of the stETH yield from Capital Providers.
1) Range of average deposited stETH over the 90 day bootstrapping period.
2) Scenario 1 is based off of the community documentation noting 7.522% of yield to be paired with Protection Fund MOR
3) Scenario 2 is the maximum potential starting price based off of 100% of yield to be paired with Protection Fund MOR
